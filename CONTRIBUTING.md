# Contributing to ChainLink

First, thank you for considering contributing to ChainLink. We welcome contributions of all sizes!

## Testing

Testing is core to our development philosophy. In building an application that will power the infrastructure of the future, we believe that well tested code is of the utmost importance. We do everything we can to ensure that [the test suite](https://travis-ci.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink) is stable and maintains a high [level of coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/smartcontractkit/chainlink/)(even if that is difficult with Go). Please write tests for your code and make sure that the existing suite continues to pass. If you run into trouble with this, you can always ask for help in [our Gitter](https://gitter.im/smartcontractkit-chainlink/Lobby).


## Golang

Please adhere to the [Go Contribution Guidelines]. Specifically, please run `go fmt` on your code before sending any pull requests.
